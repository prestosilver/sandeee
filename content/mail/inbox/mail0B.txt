ALL I WANT IS A FIB CALCULATOR. WANNA MAKE ONE FOR ME???
JUST SEND ME A PROGRAM THAT PROMPTS THE INDEX AND RETURNS FIB(INDEX).
FIB IS A SEQUENCE I'M TOO LAZY TO SPELL IN ITS ENTIRETY. EACH ITEM IS THE SUM OF THE PREVIOUS TWO. BTW YOU CAN CREATE A VAR WITH THE CODE var name = value.

I ALMOST FORGOT fib(0) = 1 AND fib(1) = 1.

ERIC WUZ HERE!!!

O ALSO YOU CAN IMPORT readInt FROM /libs/incl/sys.eon.
