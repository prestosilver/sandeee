ALL I WANT IS A FIB CALCULATOR.
MAKE ONE FOR ME???

FIB IS A SEQUENCE IM TOO LAZY TO SPELL.
EACH ITEM IS THE SUM OF THE PREVIOUS TWO.
ALSO FIB(0) = 1 AND FIB(1) = 1.

JUST SEND ME A PROGRAM THAT PROMPTS THE INDEX AND RETURNS FIB(INDEX).

O ALSO YOU CAN IMPORT read FROM /libs/inc/sys.eon.

ERIC WUZ HERE!!!
