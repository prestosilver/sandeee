ALL I WANT IS A FIB CALCULATOR.
MAKE ONE FOR ME???

FIB IS A SEQUENCE IM TOO LAZY TO SPELL.
EACH ITEM IS THE SUM OF THE PREVIOUS TWO.
I ALMOST FORGOT fib(0) = 1 AND fib(1) = 1.

JUST SEND ME A PROGRAM THAT PROMPTS THE INDEX AND RETURNS FIB(INDEX).

ERIC WUZ HERE!!!

O ALSO YOU CAN IMPORT readInt FROM /libs/inc/sys.eon.
