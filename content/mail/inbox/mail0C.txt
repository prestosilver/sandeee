LETS SEE IF YOU CAN MAKE A SIMPLE LIBRARY.
YOU CAN COMPILE LIBRARIES WITH THE elib (AND alib) COMMAND

FOR THIS FIRST LIBRARY, I WANT YOU TO MAKE A FUNCTION NAMED hello. THIS FUNCTION WILL RETURN "Hello World".
LIBRARIES IN EON ARE JUST PROGRAMS WITHOUT A main() FUNCTION.
THE LIBRARY DOSENT NEED TO IMPORT ANYTHING AND SHOULD RETURN NOT PRINT.

MAKE SURE TO SUBMIT THE COMPILED LIBRARY.
