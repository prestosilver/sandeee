Hello,

Sorry about Eric he can get a bit annoying.
I'm Spencer but everyone calls me the Spencer the String Stitcher, Stitcher for short.
I heard your getting into Eon, I recently needed a program that reverses it's input wanna program one for me?
If I remember right there's a function in sys.eon that will read a single char of input. You can convert an ASCII number to a char string with the @ operator. Just make the program print the reversed string after it reads a new line.
A new lines char has the value of 10. String concatenation might also be helpful, you can use the & operation for that.
