# This is not for everyone 

- SandEEE by nature has user facing documentation
- I am documenting this after I have a full working MVP
- In SandEEE, Bad Docs => Bad Game

---

# Didnt expect to get so much out of this
- Solid framework for what I need
- I know what SandEEE is now

---

# Where to start

- Just start, anywhere works
