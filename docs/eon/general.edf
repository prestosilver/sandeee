:center: -- EON --

-- 1 Function Structure --

An EON function should always return a value.

:code-edge:
:code:    | fn invalidFunction() {
:code:    |     doImportantStuff();
:bad-code:| }
:code-edge:

You can give a function parameters by putting names in a comma separated list inside the functions parenthesis.

:code-edge:
:code:    | fn paramters(a, b, c) {
:code:    |     return a + b * c;
:code:    | }
:code-edge:

-- 2 Variables --

In EON variables can be created with the var keyword. Variables can be initialized with an = sign.
Variables are automatically destroyed when a function ends.

:code-edge:
:code:    | fn main() {
:code:    |     var testa;
:code:    |     var testb = 10;
:code:    |
:code:    |     testa = testb * 2;
:code:    |
:code:    |     return 0;
:code:    | }
:code-edge:

If you feed a variable into a function and assign to it in the function it will override the value outside.

:code-edge:
:code:    | fn setValue(val) {
:code:    |     val = 100;
:code:    |
:code:    |     return 0;
:code:    | }
:code:    |
:code:    | fn main() {
:code:    |     var test = 10;
:code:    |
:code:    |     // this will set test to 100
:code:    |     setValue(test);
:code:    |
:code:    |     return 0;
:code:    | }
:code-edge:

You can avoid this behaviour with the dup function.

:code-edge:
:code:    | fn setValue(val) {
:code:    |     val = 100;
:code:    |
:code:    |     return 0;
:code:    | }
:code:    |
:code:    | fn main() {
:code:    |     var test = 10;
:code:    |
:code:    |     // this will not set test to 100
:code:    |     setValue(dup(test));
:code:    |
:code:    |     return 0;
:code:    | }
:code-edge:

-- 3 Code Blocks --

:h3: 3.1 Basic Code Blocks

Code can be blocked into a single statement by wrapping it in {}.
Variables in a code block are destroyed after its execution.

:code-edge:
:code:    | #include "/libs/incl/sys.eon"
:code:    |
:code:    | fn main() {
:code:    |     {
:code:    |         var tmp = 10;
:code:    |
:code:    |         print(tmp);
:code:    |     }
:code:    |
:bad-code:|     print(tmp);
:code:    |     return 0;
:code:    | }
:code-edge:

:h3: 3.2 If statements

An if statement has the following syntax.

:code-edge:
:code:    | fn main() {
:code:    |     if (0 == 0) print("0 is 0\n");
:code:    |
:code:    |     // You can also use a basic block
:code:    |     // in an if to add more statements.
:code:    |     if (0 == 0 && 0 != 1) {
:code:    |         print("0 is 0\n");
:code:    |         print("0 is also not 1\n");
:code:    |     }
:code:    |
:code:    |     return 0;
:code:    | }
:code-edge:

-- 4 Libraries --

:h3: 4.1 Header Libraries

Header Libraries can be included through the #include keyword. Header libraries are found in /libs/incl. Including a header library adds its contents directly into the current file.

:code-edge:
:code:    | #include "/libs/incl/sys.eon"
:code:    |
:code:    | fn main() {
:code:    |     print("test\n");
:code:    |     return 0;
:code:    | }
:code-edge:

:h3: 4.2 ELL Libraries

ELL Libraries can be loaded through the libload.eon header library.

:code-edge:
:code:    | #include "/libs/incl/libload.eon"
:code:    |
:code:    | fn main() {
:code:    |     setupLibLoad();
:code:    |     loadLib("/libs/texture.ell");
:code:    |     loadLib("/libs/window.ell");
:code:    |
:code:    |     return 0;
:code:    | }
:code-edge:

-- 5 Advanced Features --

EON functions can be called with too many parameters. These paramterers will be ignored by the function, this will result in an error unless you use the arguments with asm.

Say you have the function:

:code-edge:
:code:    | fn close() {
:code:    |     // closes a file
:code:    |     asm "sys 7";
:code:    |     asm "push 0";
:code:    |     asm "ret";
:code:    | }
:code:    |
:code:    | fn main() {
:code:    |     close(fileHandle);
:bad-code:|     close();
:code:    | }
:code-edge:
